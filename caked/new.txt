================================================================================
SECTION 2: REVENUE MODEL BREAKDOWN
================================================================================

HOW HE MAKES MONEY (Detailed):

1. AFFILIATE COMMISSION MODEL (Primary - 90%+ of revenue)
   - Seller posts product to TikTok Shop
   - cakedfinds creates demo/review video
   - Customer clicks product link in video
   - Customer completes purchase
   - cakedfinds earns 5-35% commission on sale
   - Commission varies by:
     * Product category
     * Seller relationship (TAP vs OC rates)
     * Commission tier agreements

2. AD SPEND ARBITRAGE (Secondary - already included in revenue)
   - Sellers fund Spark Ads to boost cakedfinds' videos
   - Sellers pay $0.01-$0.05 per ad click
   - Total ad spend across network: ~$2.5M/90 days
   - cakedfinds benefits from higher conversion rates
   - Ad spend = 38% of total revenue ($332,186/$883,690)

3. DEAL NEGOTIATIONS (Strategic)
   - cakedfinds likely negotiates elevated TAP rates
   - Standard TAP: 10-15% commission
   - Negotiated Rate: 20-25% (Dr.Melaxin, medicube)
   - 5-10% additional commission = $50-100K extra per quarter

REVENUE WATERFALL (per $1,000 in GMV):
- Customer purchases: $1,000 product
- cakedfinds commission: $150-$200 (15-20% average)
- Est. ad spend share: $120 (based on proportional ad % spend)
- Net daily revenue: $9,820
- Net daily units: ~200-300 units
- Cost per acquisition (CPA): ~$2-3 per sale

================================================================================
SECTION 3: THE 7-STEP PRODUCT SELECTION ALGORITHM
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMMISSION RATE FILTER
=============================

MINIMUM REQUIRED: 10%commission
PREFERRED RANGE: 15-20%
TARGET SWEET SPOT: 20% commission

Why 20%?: 
- $100 sale = $20 profit (before ad spend)
- High enough to justify video creation time
- Attracts seller to fund Spark Ads
- Sustainable for long-term promotion

Data-Backed Distribution:
- 20%+ Commission: 38% of inventory (PRIORITY TIER)
- 15-20% Commission: 32% of inventory (ACTIVE TIER)
- 10-15% Commission: 20% of inventory (TESTING TIER)
- 5-10% Commission: 10% of inventory (HIGH-TICKET ONLY)

Products to AVOID:
- <5% Commission products (except $300+ appliances)
- One-time commission with no recurring
- "Performance bonus" only (too unpredictable)

RED FLAGS:
- Commission dropped mid-promotion (seller reducing rate)
- No ad spend backing (seller not investing)
- Delayed commission payouts (>30 days)

STEP 2: PRICE POINT SWEET SPOT ANALYSIS
========================================

PRIMARY SWEET SPOT: $50-$150
- Highest video volume from cakedfinds
- Impulse-friendly (sub-$200)
- Good AOV (average order value)
- Proven high conversion rates

BREAKDOWN BY PRICE:
- $50-$100 price range: 45% of videos
  * Medicube skincare ($93-94) = 28+ videos
  * Dr.Melaxin products ($62-80) = 20+ videos
  * Barsys Coaster ($40.59) = 8+ videos

- $100-$150 price range: 20% of videos
  * Baby Bottle Washer ($239.99) = 8+ videos
  * Shark Appliances ($139-149) = 10+ videos
  * Hair Tools ($138.55) = 7+ videos

- $20-$50 price range: 20% of videos
  * Beauty products (tarte, makeup) = various
  * Supplements/wellness = various
  * Low-risk testing products

- <$20 price range: 10% of videos
  * Sunscreen ($17) = low risk
  * Lip products ($20) = high volume
  * Fragrances ($15.96) = niche

- >$200 price range: 5% of videos
  * Shark appliances ($300-500)
  * Ninja kitchen ($300-500)
  * High-ticket, lower volume plays

PATTERN RECOGNIZED:
- Spends 5 videos on $50-$100 range for every 1 on $300+
- Price elasticity sweet spot = $60-$80 specifically
- Products below $30 = high volume, low revenue per video
- Products above $300 = low volume, high revenue per video

SECTION 2: PRODUCT SELECTION CRITERIA - THE ALGORITHM
STEP 1: COMMISSION RATE FILTER
MINIMUM ACCEPTABLE: 10%
PREFERRED RANGE: 15-20%
TARGET SWEET SPOT: 20% commission

Why 20%?

$100 sale = $20 profit before ad costs
Justifies video creation time (~$2,000/day create 10 videos × $2/min avg)
Attracts seller to fund Spark Ads
Sustains long-term promotion cycles
Distribution in cakedfinds' Inventory:

20%+ Commission: 38% (PRIORITY)
15-20% Commission: 32% (ACTIVE)
10-15% Commission: 20% (TESTING)
5-10% Commission: 10% (HIGH-TICKET ONLY)
Products to AVOID:

Commission rate < 5% (except $300+ appliances with 10K+ units/month potential)
"Performance bonus only" structures
Delayed commissions (>30 days)
Commission rate mid-promotion drops
STEP 2: PRICE POINT OPTIMIZATION
PRIMARY SWEET SPOT: $50-$150 (45% of videos)

Medicube products ($93-94) = 28+ videos
Dr.Melaxin sets ($62-80) = 20+ videos

Hair styling tools ($400+)
Lower volume, higher AOV plays
ULTRA-LOW: <$20 (10% of videos)

Sunscreen ($17)
Fragrances ($12-16)
High volume, low revenue per video
PATTERN: For every 5 videos on $50-100, cakedfinds posts 1 video on $300+

STEP 3: CATEGORY MIX
BEAUTY & PERSONAL CARE: 52% of revenue

Skincare (primary): $9-4M per product → DAILY focus

Medicube (Glass Glow): Multiple videos daily
Dr.Melaxin (Collagen, Balms): 2-3 videos/week each
Strategy: Before/after, "glow," Korean beauty, "affordable"
Makeup: Tarte, rom&nd → 2-3 videos/week combined

Hair: RevAir ($2.2M), Bio Ionic ($2.1M) → 1-2 videos/week

✓ Keyword-rich title
✓ Recent product launch

EXAMPLES:

"Medicube Glass Glow" = "Glass Skin" is 1B+ TikTok trend

NEGATIVE SIGNALS (Avoid):
✗ <100K total TikTok views for similar products
✗ No competitor creators promoting
✗ Abstract benefits (hard to demo)
✗ Single unit vs bundle
✗ 10+ creators already promoting heavily
